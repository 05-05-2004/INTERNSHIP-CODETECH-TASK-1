# INTERNSHIP-CODETECH-TASK-1

NAME : SAMUDRALA SUPRIYA TEJASRI

COMPANY : CODETECH-IT SOLUTIONS

ID : CT6WDS89

DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE

DURATION : 5th JUNE TO 17th JULY 2024

MENTOR : SRAVANI

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : EXPLORARTORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)

OBJECTIVE :
The objective of this task is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a chosen dataset using libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. This involves understanding the dataset's structure and characteristics, analyzing the distribution of variables, exploring potential correlations between them, and identifying any outliers. Visualizing these insights through histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps will help in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the data, which is crucial for guiding subsequent data processing, modeling, or analysis steps. 

KEY ACTIVITIES :

1.Data Loading and Preprocessing: Import the dataset and perform initial preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and data cleaning.

2.Summary Statistics: Calculate basic summary statistics to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data's distribution.

3.Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms to analyze the distribution of individual variables, scatter plots to examine relationships between pairs of variables, and heatmaps to visualize correlations across the dataset.

4.Outlier Detection: Identify and analyze outliers to understand their impact on the dataset.

5.Correlation Analysis: Compute correlation coefficients to identify relationships between variables and visualize them using a heatmap.

6.Documentation and Reporting: Summarize the findings and insights gained from the EDA, supported by visualizations and statistical analysis, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

The technologies used for this task are:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations like histograms and scatter plots.

Seaborn: For making statistical graphics, including heatmaps and pair plots.

KEY INSIGHTS:

Data Structure: Understanding the types of variables and overall structure of the dataset.

Distribution Patterns: Identifying the distribution of individual variables, such as whether they are normally distributed or skewed.

Correlations: Discovering relationships between variables and identifying which variables are strongly correlated.

Outliers: Detecting any anomalies or outliers that might impact analysis.

Visual Representations: Gaining insights through visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to make data patterns more apparent.
